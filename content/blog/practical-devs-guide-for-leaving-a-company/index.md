## On the day you'll give the notice

- create document where team members could add things to be done before I leave

## After giving the notice


### Documents
- make a copy of all tax documents
- update HR system with personal email if required
- make sure personal information is up to date on HR system (address, telephone number, emails, etc)
- make a copy of payslips, at least the first ones and the last ones
- get copy or any important document
- make sure HR software/personel have your updated address and contact information in case they need to send any documents

### Laptop

#### Your own stuff
- copy all personal files to another device or to the cloud
- delete all your personal files
- logout from any personal account (email, iCloud, cloud sync software, etc)
- delete all apps that you installed for personal use
- record contributions to the team and the company (screenshots, take notes, etc)
- clear browser data
- move all personal notes
- do not copy anything that belongs to the company (code, documents, notes, screenshots, etc). Be mindful of your NDA.

#### Company's stuff
- push all the code. Make sure that all local git branches are pushed for every repository you have
- close all open PRs
- delete remote branches that are yours and that no one else will need
- make sure that any privileges you have for internal software are transfered to another team member if you're the only one with those privileges. We don't want the company to call you just because you're the only one that can log into a server
- update all your tickets in the ticket software (Jira, etc)
- find new owners for open tickets
- update tickets with all relevant information
- find new people to assume any roles you have
- find new owners to meetings that I created

### People
- get the contact of anyone you want to keep in touch if you don't already have
- endorse and recommend people on LinkedIn, if you want to
- go for a coffee with your teammates. Keep the ties strong with friends
- thank everyone that made a difference in your journey at the company

### At the end
- delete dotfiles in your home directory that may contain personal information or access to software
